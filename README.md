# BASpark

> **A Windows Desktop Particle Effect Tool:** Reconstructing the iconic Blue Archive UI interactive visual dynamics using HTML5/Canvas.

**BASpark** is a lightweight, versatile Windows desktop interactive visual effect utility dedicated to precisely reproducing the clicking and particle fluid dynamics seen in the game *Blue Archive*.

---

## Features

BASpark operates on a hybrid rendering architecture utilizing a **WPF host infrastructure powered by localized WebView2 rendering runtimes**.

* **Authentic Visual Fidelity:** Flawlessly replicates the particle responses, easing animations, and interactive textures of the classic Blue Archive visual framework.
* **Aggressive Resource Optimization:** Leveraging WebView2 lifecycle management, rendering procedures are invoked strictly upon input triggers. The graphics context completely hibernates when idle, causing zero overhead to active background processes or system resources.
* **System-Wide Environment Perception:** Full compatibility with full-screen entertainment and production environments. Real-time hook intercepting accurately routes input feedback without interrupting target processes.

---

## Getting Started

### System Specifications
* **Architecture:** Requires a 64-bit processor and native OS environment.
* **Operating System:** Windows 10 / Windows 11 (X64 architectures).
* **Memory:** Minimum 200 MB RAM allocation.
* **Graphics Unit:** Discrete or integrated graphics processing units natively supporting DirectX 11 or OpenGL runtimes.
* **Storage Matrix:** Minimum 200 MB available physical storage workspace.

### Installation
1. Navigate to the official [Releases Hub](https://github.com/DoomVoss/BASpark/releases). Download the latest setup binary: `BASpark_Installer_vX.X.X_x64.exe`.
2. Execute the installer application and follow the deployment wizard instructions to initialize the localized directory.
3. Launch the primary execution routine and enjoy the interactive effects.

## Contribution Guide

We encourage open-source community contributions. To set up your local workspace for BASpark engineering:

### Environment Setup
Clone the remote repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoomVoss/BASpark.git
cd BASpark
```

Open the project folder using Visual Studio Code (Ensure the C# Dev Kit extension suite is installed):

```bash
code .
```

* **Live Frontend Engineering:** Because the central animation loops and visual textures are structurally compiled inside HTML5/Canvas components, you can dynamically view and troubleshoot elements in src/web/ in real time via VS Code without rebuilding the whole C# runtime wrapper structure.
* When submitting an issue solution or optimization, open a formal Pull Request (https://github.com/DoomVoss/BASpark/pulls). Ensure your implementation aligns with the project’s established formatting styles and code quality rules.
